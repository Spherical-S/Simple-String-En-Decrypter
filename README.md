# Welcome to Spherical-S Simple String De/Encrypter

This is my first project using Java Swing. The main purpose was to gain experience programming apps with UI in java.

The program will take in a string in the text field, then the user may select the "encrypt" or "decrypt" button which will result in a pop up with the output of the specified action.
